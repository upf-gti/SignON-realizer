# BML Instructions
Data sent to processMsg

``` javascript
{ 
    type: "behaviours", 
    composition: "MERGE", 
    data: [ ... ] 
} 
```

Composition Types: 
``` javascript
composition: "MERGE" //default if not specified
composition: "APPEND" // block will be added at the end of the list
composition: "REPLACE" // removes overlapping blocks
```

Example of objects inside the  "data" array
``` javascript
{
    type: "faceLexeme",
    start: 0.1,
    attackPeak: 0.6,
    relax: 1.5,
    end: 1.8,
    amount: 0.1,
    lexeme: "NMF_ARCH"
}
```
The attribute ```shift``` indicates whether the action should be interpreted as the default pose to which return.

# Non Manual Features (NMF) 

## Blink
Blink is automatically executed by the realizer. However, a blink can be forced with this instruction. For a more controlled eyelid movement, use lexemes instead.
``` javascript
{
    type: "blink",
    start: 0.1
}
```

# Manual Features (MF)

```
8 directions
u=up, d=down, l=left, r=right, i=in, o=out, 
u,ul,l,dl,d,dr,r,ur, 
```
```
26 directions
u=up, d=down, l=left, r=right, i=in, o=out, 
u,ul,l,dl,d,dr,r,ur, 
uo,uol,ol,dol,do,dor,or,uor,o,
ui,uil,il,dil,di,dir,ir,uir,i,
```

All gestures share some optional attributes 
``` javascript
{
    hand: "right" || "left" || "both", // hand to apply gesture (it does NOT become the dominant hand). Defaults to "right"
    lrSym: true,  // bool, only applied to the non-dominant hand
    udSym: false, // bool, only applied to the non-dominant hand
    ioSym: false, // bool, only applied to the non-dominant hand
}
```

The dominant hand can be set through the following attribute.
``` javascript
{
    type: "gesture",
    config: { 
        dominant: "right" || "left", // which hand is considered dominant. Only needs to be set once. Affects symmetry attributes. Defaults to "right". 
    },
}
```

Attributes with the ```second``` prefix are usually optional and combines the effects of this and the same attribute without the prefix.

All gesture intructions can be packed into a single BML instruction. Caution must be taken as attributes may overlap between different gesture types. This can be useful to to reuse the same timing for several gestures  
The following example using a single BML, instructs the avatar the handshape, palmor, extfidir and the shoulder raise with the same timing variables
``` javascript
{ 
    type: "gesture",
    start: 0,   attackPeak: 0.5,   relax: 1,   end: 2, 
    shoulderRaise: "1",
    extfidir: "u", 
    palmor: "l",  
    handshape: "finger2",
    hand: "left" 
}
```
## Shoulder Raise
Raises the shoulder
``` javascript
{
    type: "gesture",
    start: 0.1,
    attackPeak: 0.2, 
    relax: 0.3,  
    end: 0.4,
    
    shoulderRaise: 0.8, // value [0,1]
    
    //optional
    shift: false, 
}
```

---
## Shoulder Hunch
Moves the shoulder forward
``` javascript
{
    type: "gesture",
    start: 0.1,
    attackPeak: 0.2, 
    relax: 0.3,  
    end: 0.4,
    
    shoulderHunch: 0.8, // value [0,1]
    
    //optional
    shift: false, 
}
```

---
## Body Movement
Moves the body (trunk). Tilt forward-backward, tilt left-right and rotate left-right. New gestures are added to the previuos one, they are not replaced.
``` javascript
{
    type: "gesture",
    start: 0.1,
    attackPeak: 0.2, 
    relax: 0.3,  
    end: 0.4,
    
    bodyMovement: "TF" || "TB" || "TL" || "TR" || "RL" || "RR",
    
    //optional
    amount: 0.5, // default to 1 
}
```

---
## Body Location
Moves the arm (wrist) to a location of the body (face + trunk).
``` javascript
{
    type: "gesture",
    start: 0.1,
    attackPeak: 0.2, 
    relax: 0.3,  
    end: 0.4,
    
    locationBodyArm: "chest", // string
   
    // optionals
    secondLocationBodyArm: "chest", // string
    side: "rr" || "r" || "l" || "ll", // string, chooses a point to the right, slightly right, slightly left or left of the chosen point
    secondSide: "l", // string

    distance: 0, // [0,1] how far from the body to locate the hand. 0 = close, 1 = arm extended
    displace: "u", // string, 26 directions. Location will be offseted into that direction
    displaceDistance: 0.05, // number how far to move to the indicated side. Metres 
 
    elbowRaise: 10, // in degrees. Positive values raise the elbow.

    //Following attributes describe which part of the hand will try to reach the locationBodyArm location 
    srcContact: "1PadPalmar", //source contact location in a single variable. Strings must be concatenate as srcFinger + srcLocation + srcSide (whenever each variable is needed). Afterwards, there is no need to use srcFinger, srcLocation or srcSide
    srcFinger: "1", // 1,2,3,4,5, see handconstellation for more information
    srcLocation: "Pad", // see handconstellation hand locations
    srcSide: "Palmar", // see handconstellation sides
    keepUpdatingContact: false, // once peak is reached, the location will be updated only if this is true. 
                // i.e.: set to false; contact tip of index; reach destination. Afterwards, changing index finger state will not modify the location
                // i.e.: set to true; contact tip of index; reach destination. Afterwards, changing index finger state (handshape) will make the location change depending on where the tip of the index is  

    shift: false, // contact information ( srcFinger, srcLocation, srcSide ) is not kept for shift
}

## Hand Constellation
Moves the hand position with respect to each other.

The motion is stopped if an arm location is executed afterwards.
``` javascript
{
    type: "gesture",
    start: 0.1,
    attackPeak: 0.2, 
    relax: 0.3,  
    end: 0.4,

    handConstellation: true,
    //Location of the hand in the specified hand (or dominant hand)
    srcContact: "2PadBack", // source contact location in a single variable. Strings must be concatenate as srcFinger + srcLocation + srcSide (whenever each variable is needed). Afterwards, there is no need to use srcFinger, srcLocation or srcSide
    srcFinger: "2", // 1,2,3,4,5. If the location does not use a finger, do not include this
    srcLocation: "Pad", // string from hand locations (although no forearm, elbow, upperarm are valid inputs here)
    srcSide: "Back", // Ulnar, Radial, Palmar, Back
     
    //Location of the hand in the unspecified hand (or non dominant hand)
    dstContact: "2Tip", // source contact location in a single variable. Strings must be concatenate as dstFinger + dstLocation + dstSide (whenever each variable is needed). Afterwards, there is no need to use dstFinger, dstLocation or dstSide
    dstFinger: "2", // 1,2,3,4,5. If the location does not use a finger, do not include this
    dstLocation: "Base", // string from hand locations or arm locations
    dstSide: "Palmar", // Ulnar, Radial, Palmar, Back 
    
    hand: "dom", // if hand=="both", both hand will try to reach each other, meeting in the middle. Otherwise, only the specified hand will move.

                    // i.e.: set to false; contact tip of index; reach destination. Afterwards, changing index finger state will not modify the location
                    // i.e.: set to true; contact tip of index; reach destination. Afterwards, changing index finger state (handshape) will make the location change depending on where the tip of the index is

## Directed Motion
Moves the arm (wrist) in a linear direction.

``distance`` and ``curveSteepness`` attributes are concurrent and not exclusive. Meaning one attribute can be 0 while the other different from 0.

The motion is stopped if an arm location is executed afterwards.
``` javascript
{
    type: "gesture",
    start: 0.1,
    attackPeak: 0.2, 
    relax: 0.3,  
    end: 0.4,

    motion: "directed",
    direction: "o", // string 26 directions
    
    // optionals
    secondDirection: "l", // string 8 directions. Will compute midpoint between direction and secondDirection.
    distance: 0.05, // number, metres of the displacement. Default 0.2 m (20 cm)
    curve: "u", // string 8 directions. Default to none
    secondCurve: "l", // string 8 directions. Will compute midpoint between curve and secondCurve.
    curveSteepness: 1, // number meaning the sharpness of the curve
    zigzag: "l", // string 26 directions
    zigzagSize: 0.05, // amplitude of zigzag (from highest to lowest point) in metres. Default 0.01 m (1 cm)
    zigzagSpeed: 3, // oscillations per second. Default 2
}
```

## Circular Motion
Moves the arm (wrist) in a circular motion.

The motion is stopped if an arm location is executed afterwards.
``` javascript
{
    type: "gesture",
    start: 0.1,
    end: 0.4,
    
    motion: "circular",
    direction: "o", // string 26 directions. Axis of rotation
    
    // optionals
    secondDirection: "l", // string 8 directions. Will compute midpoint between direction and secondDirection.
    distance: 0.05, // number, radius in metres of the circle. Default 0.05 m (5 cm)
    startAngle: 0, // where in the circle to start. 0º indicates up. Indicated in degrees. Default to 0º. [-infinity, +infinity]
    endAngle: 360, // where in the circle to finish. 0º indicates up. Indicated in degrees. Default to 360º. [-infinity, +infinity]
    zigzag: "l", // string 26 directions
    zigzagSize: 0.05, // amplitude of zigzag (from highest to lowest point) in metres. Default 0.01 m (1 cm)
    zigzagSpeed: 3, // oscillations per second. Default 2
}
```

## Fingerplay Motion
Wiggle fingers of the hand.
``` javascript
{
    type: "gesture",
    start: 0.1,
    attackPeak: 0.2, 
    relax: 0.3,  
    end: 0.4,
    
    motion: "fingerplay",

    // optionals
    speed: 2, // oscillations per second. Default 3
    intensity: 0.5, //[0,1]. Default 0.3
    fingers: "13", // string with numbers. Each number present activates a finger. 2=index, 3=middle, 4=ring, 4=pinky. I.E. "234" activates index, middle, ring but not pinky. Default all enabled
    exemptedFingers: "2", //string with numbers. Blocks a finger from doing the finger play. Default all fingers move

}
```

## Wrist Motion
Repetitive swinging, nodding and twisting of wrist (wiggle for the wrist).
``` javascript
{
    type: "gesture",
    start: 0.1,
    attackPeak: 0.2, 
    relax: 0.3,  
    end: 0.4,
    
    motion: "wrist",
    mode: "nod",
    /* either a: 
        - string from [ "nod", "nodding", "swing", "swinging", "twist", "twisting", "stirCW", "stircw", "stirCCW", "stirccw", "all" ]
        - or a value from [ 0 = None, 1 = twist, 2 = nod, swing = 4 ]. 
    Several values can co-occur by using the OR (|) operator. I.E. ( 2 | 4 ) = stirCW
    Several values can co-occur by summing the values. I.E. ( 2 + 4 ) = stirCW
    */

    // optionals
    speed: 3, // oscillations per second. Negative values accepted. Default 3. 
    intensity: 0.3, // [0,1]. Default 0.3
}
```
